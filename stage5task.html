        <h2>STAGE 5 TASK : HNG INTERNSHIP MANAGEMENT APP</h2>
        <p><b>OVERVIEW</b></p>
        <p>You will be grouped into 2 groups, your task is to come up with a solution that:</p>

        <p>1. Help us manage the internship better.</p>
        <p>2. Help us grade people faster.</p>
        <p>3. Makes sure we have a full database of the interns</p>
        <h5>You are to:</h5>
        <p>1. Come up with a plan and implement it.</p>
        <p>You also need to consider the following:</p>
        <p>- the internship needs to reach more areas like the northen part of nigeria and other areas<br>that have little to no tech presence.</p>
        <p>your solution should seek to solve this problem.</p>
        <p>2. your project managers are @seunfunmi - PM + @ponyeador - PM </p>
        <p>They will create pivotal tracker accounts and manage your projects from there</p>
        <p>You will be assigned points based on your activities throughout, the project managers will<br> work hand in hand with the team lead to ensure this is done properly.</p>
        <p>There will be no excuse or nepa or other things like that.<br>
        If you pass, you will be promoted to stage 6 alongside those presently in stage 5.</p>
        <p>Don't hold back, work towards impressing and getting more points.</p>
        <p>Be at the fore-front in the channel, because even if project managers claim you did something,<br> and your team lead said you did it,</p>
        <p>If I don't see you active in the channel, I won't approve your promotion.</p>
        <p>Good luck, you have till Friday, 7pm.</p>
